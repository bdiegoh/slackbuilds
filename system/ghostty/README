Ghostty is a fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal
emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

Note:

Zig 0.13.0 is required for 1.1.x series.

The build process fetch dependencies from the internet. To proper do an offline build,
the dependencies need to be download first and make available in a location the SlackBuild
can access.

Ghostty provide a script to do this and at the moment I'm looking into the best
way to integrate it with the SlackBuild.
