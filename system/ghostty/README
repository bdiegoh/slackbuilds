emulator that uses platform-native UI and GPU acceleration.

Note:

At the moment ghostty is only supported for Slackware current, mainly because
of dependencies.

Zig 0.14.1 is required for 1.2.x series. To use this SlackBuild be sure to have
the zig 0.14.1 binary in your PATH variable.

gtk4-layer-shell is required for Ghostty 1.2.x. A SlackBuild based on the
gtk-layer-shell can be found in libraries/gtk4-layer-shell in this repo.


The build process fetch dependencies from the internet. To proper do an offline build,
the dependencies need to be download first and make available in a location the SlackBuild
can access.

Ghostty provide a script to do this and at the moment I'm looking into the best
way to integrate it with the SlackBuild. Not a priority until Ghostty is out of current.
