Note:

At the moment ghostty is only supported for Slackware current, mainly because
of dependencies.

Zig 0.14.1 is required for 1.2.x series. To use this SlackBuild be sure to have
the zig 0.14.1 binary in your PATH variable.

gtk4-layer-shell is required for Ghostty 1.2.x. A SlackBuild based on the
gtk-layer-shell can be found in libraries/gtk4-layer-shell in this repo.

Note:

Update build script to use fetch-zig-cache.sh and set DESTDIR to avoid resource
linked to the tmp folder.
Disable doc generation as pandoc has a lot of dependencies, will enable
in the future.
